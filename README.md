# Contribution

Draw an image on your GitHub contribution graph.

#### Examples

| ![Heart](image/result/heart.png)            | ![Skull](image/result/skull.png)            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ![Creeper](image/result/creeper.png)        | ![I need a job](image/result/ineedajob.png) |


## How does it work?

GitHub displays commits in the contribution history graph. Contribution pushes 
a bunch of commits with a custom date using `git commit --date <date>`. It 
bundles multiple commits on a single day to achieve a darker pixel in the graph.

The GitHub contribution graph is 52 Ã— 7 pixels and shows up to five shades for
activity. This app automatically limits the colors and dimensions of your input 
image to match these restrictions. Use the [preview](#contribution-preview--help) 
subcommand if you're not feeling lucky.

Warning: you cannot remove contribution activity on GitHub unless you delete a 
project, so you probably want to push to a project specifically created for 
this purpose. Contributions to secret projects may also be shown, depending on 
your GitHub settings.

Contribution uses your default SSH and Git user, which can be tested with 
`ssh -T git@github.com` and `git config --global user.email`. If you prefer to 
use another identity, set GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i /other/id_rsa' and/or 
`git config --global user.email "other@example.org"`.
